# Description

This is a python code interpreter that uses speech reconition to take in a command parse it via an llm namely azure gpt-3.5 in this case and the llm will return a python code string that will be executed by the iterpreter. it just a prototype to show off some ideas and to get some feedback.

## inspired by the following

inspired by but in no way coppied from [Open-Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter) this project is a prototype of some ideas discussed with Killian and is an attempt to make some cool interactions with the command line and python. and very little overhead.

[KillianLucas](https://github.com/KillianLucas) and his [Open-Interpreter](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter)
and [DarkAcorn](https://github.com/darkacorn) for moral support ðŸ˜Š
